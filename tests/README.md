These steps should be carried out only once:

2. Create an object with the path where the files are downloaded.

`proj_dir <-"/Users/....."`

3. Execute the following command:
`setwd(proj_dir)`

4. Execute the following command:
`set_here()`

4. Open the file `run_tests.R` directly from the folder where it is saved.
